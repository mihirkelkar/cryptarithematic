This program computes arithematically correct outputs by assigning unique numbers to input strings. 

The program computes all possible assignment computations and then prints out those which are arithematically correct. This is essentially brute forcing. 


The input strings are present in an array called puzzles within the code and are hardcoded for now.


The output is written to a file called sendmoremoeny.txt which gets created in the pwd everytime you run the code.
